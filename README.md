# CS2263project2025
Project for class 2025 CS2263

The basic flow of this program is that players enter a dungeon filled with rooms. In each room they will encounter something.

Their quest is to find the magical goblet hidden somewhere in the dungeon, then find the exit (which is not the way they came in).

The Dungeon is filled with Rooms. Each room contains one Scenario.
These Scenarios might be Encounters with NPCs, Monsters, or Traps.

The Player has hit points (HP) and various stats that affect how they manage these dangerous situations. 

They can also collect better equipment and items in the dungeon to increase these stats (found free or bought for 5 gold). They can also find and use healing potions to recover HP (5HP each).
